I am used to the emoji short text where you can put something like `: blush :` in your text and it pops up like a nice emoij :blush:. When I first did this on my blog, nothing happened. 

Apparently, you need to install a special compatible plugin **jemoji** to get the emoji working on Github pages. The short manual:

## Steps

---

Add the following to your site's Gemfile
```
gem 'jemoji'
```
And add the following to your site's _config.yml
```
plugins:
  - jemoji
```
If you are working on a local machine, run
```
$ bundle install
```
If not, just do a new commit to your Jekyll repository and it will trigger the new plugin to be build.
