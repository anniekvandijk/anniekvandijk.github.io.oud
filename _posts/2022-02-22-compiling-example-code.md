## What do you need?

All you need is a **.NET Fiddle account** and a saved Fiddle. A Fiddle is like a Github Gist, but only for .NET code. 

There are more tools online that can compile code. I chose .NET Fiddle, because it has nice code completion, Code Highlighting and can be embedded.

## How is this different from embedding a Github Gists?

It is not very different. But, it will only show a nice block of code, which does not compile. 

<script src="https://gist.github.com/anniekvandijk/53bed85ec375805cbf4727285635528a.js"></script>

Microsoft is developing a tool (Try .NET) that can run Gists in the browser. But it is not released to the public (yet). See [**Try .NET**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/try-dotnet).

## Embed the Fiddle

In the .NET Fiddle menu you press the 'Share Button' and copy the 'Embed on Your Page code'.

Then you paste the code block in your editor. It looks like this:  
```HTML
<iframe width="100%" height="475" src="https://dotnetfiddle.net/Widget/c4S4dB" frameborder="0"></iframe>
```
And now you have a running code block on your site :sunglasses:
