This is my first post ever on a personal blog page. Why now? 

I am working on a new project and I have some trouble finding information to help solve some challenges. I really like when someone takes the time to write a helpfull article. So I figured, this time maybe it is my turn to create some blog posts about my challenges and how I solved it. 

You can go to a site like Medium and start a blog there. I first thought this was the best way. But the problem is, you have no influence over this site. If they take your blog down, there is nothing you can do. 

Then I discovered Github Pages. You can start a free blog on Github really easy. 
1. Create a Github account
2. Get a Jekyll template
3. Create Github Pages repository
4. Learn some Markdown and write your first blog

**Github** is a place where people all over the world store and share there software and work together on software. **Github Pages** is for hosting websites for your project information on Github. But you can do other things like hosting a blog website for personal use.

**Jekyll** is a blog-aware static site generator. Yehhh! It means it spits out plain text and shows it on a website. You do not have to be a developer to make nice websites!

Plain text is a bit boring. So some styling would be nice! **Markdown** is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.

## Step 1. Create a Github account 

Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com/) and make an GitHub Free account. Pay attention to your username, because this will be visible in your blog url. 

My accountname is anniekvandijk and my Github url is https://github.com/anniekvandijk

## Step 2. get a Jekyll template

Go to [Jekyll templates free section](https://jekyllthemes.io/free) and find a nice free blog template. Most themes have a theme starter to get you up and running very quick. 

As an example, we can use Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme starter. Their normal tempalte i:s [Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/minimal-mistakes). When you go to their site on Github via the link at the bottom and scroll through their readme you can find a link to the starter. Or, you just go to it by clicking [here](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter). In the readme you find a link to start the installation. When you click on it you are asked to create a new repository.

Important about this step. The name of the repository must be in a special format: \<username>.github.io. Because my username is anniekvandijk, I make a repository with the name anniekvandijk.github.io. It has to be a public repository.

Your site should be running after creating the repository!!!
In my case on https://anniekvandijk.github.io/.

## Step 4. Markdown
